Deploying and Calling Contracts
###############################

Running a Node
--------------

To start interacting on a test smart contract network you'll need to clone the `sc-alpha` branch of the `Full Node <https://github.com/stratisproject/StratisBitcoinFullNode>`_ locally.

The smart contract daemon is located in the ``src/Stratis.StratisSmartContractsD`` folder. With the command line open in this directory, you can run the following command to start a node and join our test network:

::

  dotnet run -addnode=13.64.119.220 -addnode=20.190.57.145 -addnode=40.68.165.12

.. warning::
  The smart contract test network will break. We provide no guarantee of its uptime and may reset the network as deemed necessary. For the most up-to-date information, join us on Discord: :ref:`support_and_community`.

Create a Wallet
---------------

Interacting with contracts requires funds. As with making any transaction, users must pay a fee to include transactions in a block and will need to pay a fee for contract execution as well. We call this fee "gas".

The smart contract API hasn't yet been integrated with any GUI wallets, so for now we use the API directly via swagger. Whilst your node is running, navigate to `localhost:38220/swagger <localhost:38220/swagger>`_.

Under the `Wallet` header, find the call for `/api/Wallet/create`. You can create a new wallet on this node by filling in just the name and password properties on the request:

::

  {
    "name": "Satoshi",
    "password": "password"
  }

You now have a wallet with addresses good to go. To check these addresses out, navigate to the call for `/api/Wallet/addresses`. You can see a list of addresses by inputting the wallet name you just used above and the account name ``account 0``.

Get Funded
----------

The easiest way for you to get some test coins to use for deploying and calling contracts will be to hit us up on Discord: :ref:`support_and_community`.

Alternatively, if you want to get more involved and earn some test coins along the way, feel free to start mining! To do so, when you start your node add a couple of extra parameters:

::

  dotnet run -addnode=13.64.119.220 -addnode=20.190.57.145 -addnode=40.68.165.12 -mine=1 -mineaddress=oneofyouraddresseshere

Contract Deployment
-------------------

A contract must be deployed before it can be used. A Stratis smart contract deployment involves several steps:

* Compilation of the contract
* Validation of the contract
* Creating a transaction with the contractâ€™s code
* Broadcasting the transaction to the network

The command line tool ``sct`` combines these steps and simplifies the process.

Deployment of a C# source file
--------------------

Command line tool
'''''''''''
The command line tool is available in the smart contracts source code repository. To run the tool from the command line, you first need to change into its directory:

::

  cd src/Stratis.SmartContracts.Tools.Sct

Deployment
''''
A smart contract can be deployed from the command line tool using a sub-command, deploy. This will compile the contract, validate its bytecode, create a transaction and broadcast it to a node.

A contract can only be deployed to a node running locally, using a local wallet, account, and password. These must be provided to the deployment tool, as well as the name of the file to deploy.

::

  dotnet run -- deploy Contract.cs http://localhost:38220 -wallet mywallet -account "account 0" -password password -fee 1000 -gasprice 1 -gaslimit 30000


Success
'''''''
If the contract was deployed successfully, the tool will return the address of the contract.

Deployment with constructor params
'''''''
If the contract you are deploying accepts constructor params, you can additionally pass these in to the command line tool via the ``params`` argument.

These params must be serialized into a string. The format of each parameter is "{0}#{1}", where {0} is an integer representing the Type of the serialized data, and {1} is the serialized data itself.

Multiple params must be specified in order and can be done like so: ``-param="7#abc" -param="8#123"``.

Currently, only certain Types of data can be serialized. Refer to the following table for the mapping between Type and its integer mapping.

.. csv-table:: Param Type Serialization
  :header: "Type", "Integer representing
   serialized type", "Serialize to string"

  System.Boolean, 1, System.Boolean.ToString()
  System.Byte, 2, System.Byte.ToString()  
  System.Byte[], 3, BitConverter.ToString()
  System.Char, 4, System.Char.ToString()
  System.SByte, 5, System.SByte.ToString()
  System.Short, 6, System.Short.ToString()
  System.String, 7, System.String
  System.UInt32, 8, System.UInt32.ToString()
  NBitcoin.UInt160, 9, NBitcoin.UInt160.ToString()
  System.UInt64, 10, System.UInt64.ToString()
  Stratis.SmartContracts.Address, 11, Stratis.SmartContracts.Address.ToString()
  System.Int64, 12, System.Int64.ToString()

.. note::
    The requirement to pass in the Type is ugly, but it allows us to resolve overloaded methods easily.

Example
-------------
A smart contract has a constructor with the following signature:

::

  public Token(ISmartContractState state, UInt160 owner, UInt64 supply, Byte[] secretBytes)

In addition to the mandatory ISmartContractState, there are 3 params which need to be supplied. Let's assume they have these values:

* UInt160 owner = 0x95D34980095380851902ccd9A1Fb4C813C2cb639
* UInt64 supply = 1000000
* Byte[] secretBytes = { 0xAD, 0xBC, 0xCD }

The command for passing these params to sct looks like this:

::

  -param="9#0x95D34980095380851902ccd9A1Fb4C813C2cb639" -param="10#1000000" -param="3#AD-BC-CD"
